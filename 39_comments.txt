Section 05: Comments
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments

	- Are programmer explanations embedded in the source code
	  
	- They are also notes, annotations, and anything the
	  program is doing

	- Comments never make it to the compiler

	- In C++, the preprocessor strips out the comments, so
	  the compiler never sees them


Comments Types

	- Single line comment includes two forward slashes "//"

	- Single line comment example:

		// this is a single line comment

	- Multi-line comment includes a forward slash followed
	  by two stars and another foward slash "/**/"

	- Multi-line comment example:

		/*
		 * This is a multi-line comment
		 * with more lines of comments
		*/
